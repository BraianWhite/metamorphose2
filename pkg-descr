A graphical, cross platform, mass renaming tool with many powerful functions. Well suited for those
that need to rename many files and/or folders on a regular basis. In addition to
general usage operations, it is useful for photo and music collections,
webmasters, programmers, legal and clerical, et cetera.

Some features include the use of regular expressions, providing a preview prior to changes, and
acting recursively through directories and subdirectories.
