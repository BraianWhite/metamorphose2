
I did not make these icons, there are a mix and match of the following:

256 color icons are part of the 'U-Bahn Station "Südstern" (Berlin)' desktop
theme created by Barbara Kämper (brief@barbarakaemper.de).
These icons are released under the terms of the
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.
If you like them then why not get the whole theme from:
http://www.barbarakaemper.de/

Alfa channel stuff from 'Buuf Iconset' set By Paul Davey A.K.A. Mattahan.
Entire (1500 !) set of 128x128 pngs:

Flag icons part of set by Mark James.
Available for free use for any purpose.

Some were renamed to make assigning them to the code more logical, and some
had to be converted to ico format from png.
